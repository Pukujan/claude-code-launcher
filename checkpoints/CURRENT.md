This is an as-of projection; live GitHub issues own progression. Link the owning leaf, parent ancestry and dependencies for active work.

## Program state

Phase: Windows installer for a friend.

## Completed

- continuity protocol initialized.
- **CCL-0001**: the agent stack is on `main` behind the required `gates` check ([issue #1](https://github.com/Pukujan/claude-code-launcher/issues/1), PR #2, merge `0357326`).
- **CCL-0002**: both launchers and the shared LiteLLM files run from this repository ([issue #3](https://github.com/Pukujan/claude-code-launcher/issues/3), PR #8, merge `de5694a`).
- IRE fetch at launch, `shared/ire/` ([issue #4](https://github.com/Pukujan/claude-code-launcher/issues/4) work, PR #10, merge `2b49adf`; another worker).
- **CCL-0006**: fallback ladder picker for main and advisor, applied live ([issue #5](https://github.com/Pukujan/claude-code-launcher/issues/5), PR #12).
- **CCL-0013**: cx primaries in Responses mode, hand-picked ladders, picking from the Top 20 or the frontier list ([issue #13](https://github.com/Pukujan/claude-code-launcher/issues/13), PR #14).
- **CCL-0021**: bench a model after it uses up its retries ([issue #21](https://github.com/Pukujan/claude-code-launcher/issues/21)).
- **CCL-0061**: one-command Windows installer ([issue #61](https://github.com/Pukujan/claude-code-launcher/issues/61), PR #62, merge `1f046f7`, release `v1.0.0-windows`).
- **CCL-0063**: Windows installer v1.0.1: the six holdout fixes, one self-contained install folder (private tools, `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` inside), poppler for PDF pages, #70's ripgrep limit kept ([issue #63](https://github.com/Pukujan/claude-code-launcher/issues/63), PR #66, release `v1.0.1-windows`).

## Active

- **CCL-0072**: Windows installer v1.0.2: uninstall never edits a Claude config it can't prove it wrote, cleanup works without `app\`, a user-set search timeout survives unsync ([issue #72](https://github.com/Pukujan/claude-code-launcher/issues/72), branch `ccl-0072-windows-v102`).
- **CCL-0064**: every launcher key from one gitignored `.env` in the launcher folder, the IRE and Desktop env files only as a fallback ([issue #64](https://github.com/Pukujan/claude-code-launcher/issues/64), branch `ccl-0064-launcher-env`).

## Queued

- Re-sync `windows/launch-claude-inferhub.ps1` from the PC after the pending fixes there.
- Windows picker on the live IRE table.

## Blockers

None known.

## Next atomic action

Publish `v1.0.2-windows` from the #72 PR merge, close #72 and pull main on the PC.
